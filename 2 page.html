        <p id="subh1">&#9830;What is QUANTUM COMPUTING?</p>
        <p id="subh1p1">&#9679;To get the answer of this Question first we need to find out the meaning of <mark>"QUANTUM"</mark>.</p>
        <p id="subh1p2"> QUANTUM -> Quantum is the <mark>SMALLEST UNIT</mark> to measure a thing or a work.

        EXAMPLE :- Quantum of Light - PHOTON
                               Quantum of Electricity - ELECTRON
        </p>
        <p id="subh1p3">&#9679;QUANTUM COMPUTING -> It means that the COMPUTING will be done on ATOMIC or SUB-ATOMIC level.</p>

        <p id="subh2">&#9830;How QUANTUM COMPUTING works?</p>
        <p id="subh2p1">&#9679;Let'S First understand how a normal computer works.</p>
        <p id="subh2p2">&#9679;The main part or the Brain of the computer is CPU (as we all know). The architecture of CPU is based on a SILICON WAFER which has very small circuits. In these cicuits there are so many TRANSISTORS present. </p>
        <p id="subh2p3">A TRANSISTOR is basically A Switch or A Data Procssor that can either block or open the way for Information coming through. These Informations are made up of BITS which can be either <mark>"0"</mark> or <mark>"1"</mark>.Combinations of several BITS makes The Information.</p>
        <p id="subh2p5">&#9679;This is how our basic or traditional Computer works.Now The <mark>QUANTUM COMPUTING.</mark></p>
        <p id="subh2p6">&#9679;In QUANTUM COMPUTING the ATOMS will be set on <mark>OUANTUM SUPERPOSITIONS</mark> where its ALGORITHMS will run. </p><hr>
        <p id="subh3">&#9830;What is OUANTUM SUPERPOSITION?</p>
        <p id="subh3p1">&#9679;QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION is based how The BITS of computer works. Normally The position of BITS will be either "0" or "1" at a time. It means that in normal computers the BITS will work different at one time. But in OUANTUM SUPERPOSITION it's not necessary that the BITS will be different at a time , they can be in any proportion of both states at once.</p><hr>
