        <p id="subh1">&#9830;AI</p>
        <p id="subh1p1">&#9679;This word is very small but has a power to <mark>CONTROL THE WORLD</mark> But How? Let's decode this question.</p>
        <p id="subh1p2">&#9679;AI(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) uses Algorithms which makes decisions using Real-Time data. They are unlike passive machine that are capable only of doing mechanical work or predetermined work.AI's have their own mind to complete the tasks.</p>

        <h3 id="subh2">&#9830;Stages of AI</h3>
        <p id="subh2p1">&#9679;AI is divided into 7 stages:-</p>
        
        <ul id="subh2li">
            <li>RULE BASED AI SYSTEM -> In the First stage of AI , it only follows rules. AI cannot learn,understand or change The rules in this stage</li><br>
            <li>CONTEXT AWARE SYSTEM -> In the Second stage of AI , it can use it's previous knowledge and improves.</li><br>
            <li>DOMAIN SPECIFIC MASTERY -> In the Third stage of AI , it masters on a specific work or task.</li><br>
            <li>THINKING AND REASONING AI -> In  the Fourth stage if AI , the AI can think and understand the given task or work.</li><br>
            <li>ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE -> In the Fifth stage of AI , it can learn by itself and has intelligence equal to human.</li><br>
            <li>ARTIFICIAL SUPER INTELLIGENCE -> In the Sixth stage of AI , it's intelligence will be greter than human's.</li><br>
            <li>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SINGULARITY -> In the Seventh stage of AI , it can control the whole world and will be very evolved than human</li><br>
        </ul><hr>
        <h3 id="subh3">&#9830;What is AGI?</h3>
        <p id="subh3p1">&#9679;AGI stands for ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE. It is the Fifth stage of AI. It is a type of Intelligence which not only can  analyse it's existing data and do tasks but also can make new solutions and can learn by itself. It's intelligence is equal to human intelligence.</p><hr>
        <h3 id="subh4">&#9830;Fetures of AGI.</h3>
        <ul id="subh4li">
            <li>Abstract Thinking</li><br>
            <li>Common Sense</li><br>
            <li>Cause and Effect</li><br>
            <li>Better than Humans</li><br>
        </ul><hr>
        <h3 id="subh5">&#9830;Pros of AGI.</h3>
        <ul id="subh5li">
            <li>Helpful in Health sector</li><br>
            <li>Crisis of Doctors/Nurses can be fulfilld by AGI</li><br>
            <li>Financial Decisions</li><br>
            <li>Helps in Investment and Profit Detection</li><br>
            <li>Helps in Education sector</li><br>
